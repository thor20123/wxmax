#summary Things that still need to be done

As of v1.00 of wxMax, we've removed the list of completed items, in order to make it easier to see what's still outstanding.
If you can't see it in the list it is probably complete. If it isn't, you can always [http://code.google.com/p/wxmax/issues/list add an issue].

Crossed-off widgets imply code-completion, but not necessarily complete documentation.

  * wxApp (one or two outstanding method/functions)
  * wxArchive
  * wxArchiveInputStream
  * wxArchiveOutputStream
  * wxComboCtrl
  * wxGLCanvas (mostly working)
  * wxSheet
  * wxHtmlWindow (core functionality working)
  * wxMediaCtrl
  * wxRichTextCtrl
  * wxTarEntry
  * wxTarInputStream
  * wxTarOutputStream
  * wxWindow (one or two outstanding method/functions)

 
 ===Third Party components===
These are non-standard wxWidgets components that happen to be very useful and can add a lot to an application.

  * wxPdfDocument (one or two outstanding method/functions)
  * wxPropGrid (mostly working)
  * ~~wxRarInputStream~~ (Doesn't work as a proper intput stream, so this is actually a bit of a hack to get it working with the latest rar source. Better than nothing for now?)
  * wxScintilla (one or two outstanding method/functions)
  * wxSheet (core functionality working)
  * wxSpinCtrlDbl
