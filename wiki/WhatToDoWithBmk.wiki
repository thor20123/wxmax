#summary Building and using the tweaked BMK

You can download the tweaked BMK from [http://brucey.net/programming/blitz/index.php#tweakedbmk here].

You should compile `bmk.bmx` in non-GUI and non-debug mode. This will result in a command-line executable called `bmk` (or `bmk.exe` on Win32).

This executable should be copied into your `BlitzMax/bin` folder. It is intended to replace the official app of the same name.
_You should take a backup of the official BMK app before you overwrite it - just in case!_


Once you have it installed, building and compiling will work as before, except that it can now process special compiler and linking directives - required for wxMax.
