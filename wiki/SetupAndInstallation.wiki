= Installing the module =

== Downloads ==

There are a few things you will need before you can start building your own BlitzMax GUI apps with wxWidgets.

  * The wxWidgets headers
  * A set of wxWidgets library files

Both of these can be downloaded from the [http://code.google.com/p/wxmax/downloads/list Downloads] section.

== Module Source ==

Until we have a stable enough code-base, you will need to use the Subversion repository to retrieve the BlitzMax source for the module. See the [http://code.google.com/p/wxmax/source Source] section for details of how to get it.

You can either have the source located directly in the `BlitzMax/mod` folder, or you will have to copy the folder (`wx.mod`) to that location once you've retrieved it from the repository.

= Setup =

The headers should be unzipped in the `wx.mod/include/` folder. It will create a new folder called `wx`.

The library files should be unzipped into the `wx.mod/lib/` folder. It will create a folder based on the libraries you install (e.g. `linux`, for the Linux libraries).

With the module at `BlitzMax/mod/wx.mod` and the headers and libraries in their correct locations, it should be a simple matter of building the modules in your IDE.
It may take a while the first time, since there is a lot to compile.

== Building ==

If you don't already have it, you will need to use a modified version of BMK (the BlitzMax make utility), as it requires use of custom compiler flags - something the official BMK doesn't support. You can get it [http://brucey.net/programming/blitz/index.php#tweakedbmk from here]. (see also WhatToDoWithBmk).

== Samples ==

Once everything is built, why not try out one of the sample apps that comes with the module, in `wx.mod/samples/`.
